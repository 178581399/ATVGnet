### Introduction

This repository contains the original models (AT-net, VG-net) described in the paper "Hierarchical Cross-modal Talking Face Generation with Dynamic Pixel-wise Loss" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02427). This code can be applied directly in [LRW](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrw1.html) and [GRID](http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gridcorpus/). The outputs from the model are visualized here: the first one is the synthesized landmark from ATnet, the rest of them are attention, motion map and final results from VGnet.

### Disclaimer and known issues

0. These codes are implmented in Pytorch
0. In this paper, we train LRW and GRID seperately.
0. The model are sensitive to input images. Please use the correct preprocessing code.
0. I didn't finish the data processing code yet. I will release it soon. But you can try the model and replace with your own image.
0. If you want to train these models using this version of pytorch without modifications, please notice that:
	- You need at lest 12 GB GPU memory.
	- There might be some other untested issues.
